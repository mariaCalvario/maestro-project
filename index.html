      <h2>The MAESTRO</h2>

      <p>
        Born in 1951 in the beautiful city of Porto, Jos√© Calv√°rio was a
        brilliant portuguese composer, arranger, conductor, and record producer.
        <br />
        He was a man way ahead of his time, started practicing the piano at a
        very early age and quite successfully so, judging by the fact that, aged
        six, he gave his first recital. By the age of 10, he performed as a
        piano soloist with the Philharmonic Orchestra of Porto.

        The 1974 melodious love ballad by the title of "<strong
          >E Depois do Adeus</strong
        >", is a remarkable song in more than one way. It won a ticket to the
        Eurovision Song Contest in Brighton, where Jos√© Calv√°rio made his first
        of four appearances as a conductor in the contest, aged 23 and thereby
        one of the youngest ever to conduct in this competition. A couple of
        weeks after the contest, in Portugal, the<strong>
          Carnation Revolution</strong
        >
        broke out, a coup by lower military with left-wing sympathies which
        ousted the dictatorial regime from power. The airing of "E Depois do
        Adeus" on the Emissores Associados de Lisboa radio station on April
        24th, was the <strong> preconcerted signal</strong> for the
        revolutionaries to start their planned action. Needless to say, "E
        Depois do Adeus" has gone on to become one of the most well-known songs
        in Portuguese popular music of all times.
